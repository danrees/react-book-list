# Personal React Test #

This is just a simple app to test out React.

There is a list of books, each book has an author, that author has a name and
a link to their wikipedia page.

Using the following tutorials for inspiration:

- https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html
- https://scotch.io/tutorials/react-on-the-server-for-beginners-build-a-universal-react-and-node-app

## Technical stuff ##

### React ###

This is for myself to get used to (again) [Reactjs](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

### Other JS Stuff ###

I'm using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as the module builder, [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
for dependency management and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile for ES6 down.
